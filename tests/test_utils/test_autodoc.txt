Class to perform Jupyter Notebook Regression tests.

Parameters
----------
exec_notebook: bool
    Create a new notebook, by executing all cells in the original notebook This value is
    accessible, after initialization, via the ``exec_notebook`` attribute. Default: True

exec_cwd: str, NoneType
    Path to the directory which the notebook will run in (defaults to directory of
    notebook). This value is accessible, after initialization, via the ``exec_cwd``
    attribute. Default: None

exec_allow_errors: bool
    Do not stop execution after the first unexpected exception (where cell is not tagged
    ``raises-exception``). This value is accessible, after initialization, via the
    ``exec_allow_errors`` attribute. Default: False

exec_timeout: int
    The maximum time to wait (in seconds) for execution of each cell. This value is
    accessible, after initialization, via the ``exec_timeout`` attribute. Default: 120

coverage: bool
    Record coverage data, with coverage.py. This value is accessible, after initialization,
    via the ``coverage`` attribute. Default: False

cov_config: str, NoneType
    Determines what coverage configuration file to read. This value is accessible, after
    initialization, via the ``cov_config`` attribute. Default: None

cov_source: str, Tuple[str]
    A list of file paths or package names to measure coverage for. This value is accessible,
    after initialization, via the ``cov_source`` attribute. Default: None

cov_merge: coverage.control.Coverage, NoneType
    A coverage.Coverage instance, to merge coverage results with. This value is accessible,
    after initialization, via the ``cov_merge`` attribute. Default: None

post_processors: tuple
    post-processors to apply to the new workbook, relating to entry points in the
    'nbreg.post_proc' group This value is accessible, after initialization, via the
    ``post_processors`` attribute. Default: ('coalesce_streams',)

process_resources: dict
    Resources to parse to processor functions. This value is accessible, after
    initialization, via the ``process_resources`` attribute. Default: Factory(factory=<class
    'dict'>, takes_self=False)

diff_replace: tuple
    A list of regex replacements to apply before diffing, e.g. ``[('/cells/*/outputs',
    '\d{2,4}-\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}', 'DATE-STAMP')]``. This value is accessible, after
    initialization, via the ``diff_replace`` attribute. Default: ()

diff_ignore: tuple
    List of diff paths to ignore, e.g. '/cells/1/outputs' or '/cells/\*/metadata'. This
    value is accessible, after initialization, via the ``diff_ignore`` attribute. Default:
    ('/cells/*/outputs/*/traceback',)

diff_use_color: bool
    Use ANSI color code escapes for text output. This value is accessible, after
    initialization, via the ``diff_use_color`` attribute. Default: True

diff_color_words: bool
    Highlight changed words using only colors. This value is accessible, after
    initialization, via the ``diff_color_words`` attribute. Default: False

force_regen: bool
    Re-generate notebook files, if no unexpected execution errors, and an output path has
    been supplied. This value is accessible, after initialization, via the ``force_regen``
    attribute. Default: False
