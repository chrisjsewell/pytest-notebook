Purpose
-------

The purpose of the plugin is to ensure that changes to the python
environment (e.g. updating packages), have not affected the outputs
of the notebook. If the notebook has changed, this plugin can also
regenerate the notebooks, saving the new outputs.

Features
--------

-  Recognise, collect, execute then diff input
   vs.Â output `Jupyter`_ Notebooks.

-  Provides clear and colorized diffs of the notebooks (using `nbdime`_)

-  Regenerate failing notebooks (see :ref:`regen_notebooks`).

-  A well defined API allows notebook regression tests to be run in multiple ways
   (see :ref:`pytest_notebook_by_example`):

   1. Using the pytest test collection architecture.
   2. As a pytest fixtures.
   3. Using the ``pytest_notebook`` python package.

-  All stages are highly configurable (see :ref:`configuring_pytest_notebook`) *via*:

   1. The pytest command-line interface.
   2. The pytest configuration file.
   3. The notebook and cell level metadata.

-  Post-processor plugin entry-points, allow for customisable
   modifications of the notebook, including source code formatting with
   `black`_ (see :ref:`post_processors`).
