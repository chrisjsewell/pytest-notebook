A [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) plugin for regression testing and regenerating [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

![Example Test](pytest-notebook-screenshot.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose

The purpose of the plugin is to ensure that changes to the python
environment (e.g. updating packages), have not affected the outputs
of the notebook. If the notebook has changed, this plugin can also
regenerate the notebooks, saving the new outputs.

## Features

- Recognise, collect, execute (optionally output) then diff input vs. output [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
- Provides clear and colorized diffs of the notebooks (using [nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io))
- Regenerate failing notebooks.
- Integration with [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io) and [pytest_cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io).

- A well defined API allows notebook regression tests to be run:

    1. Using the pytest test collection architecture.
    2. As a pytest fixtures (`nb_regression.check(filename)`).
    3. Using the `pytest_notebook` python package.

- All stages are highly configurable *via*:

    1. The pytest command-line interface.
    2. The pytest configuration file.
    3. The notebook and cell level metadata.

- Post-processor plugin entry-points, allow for customisable modifications of the notebook,
  including source code formatting with [black](https://github.com/ambv/black)

## Installation

To install from [Conda](https://docs.conda.io) (recommended):

```shell
>> conda install -c conda-forge pytest-notebook
```

To install *via* [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project):

```shell
>> pip install pytest-notebook
```

To install the development version:

```shell
>> git clone https://github.com/chrisjsewell/pytest-notebook .
>> cd pytest-notebook
>> pip install --upgrade pip
>> pip install -e .
>> # pip install -e .[code_style,testing,docs] # install extras for more features
```

## Usage

See the documentation at: http://pytest-notebook.readthedocs.io/

If you want to test some sample notebooks, add the `--nb-test-files` flag:

```shell
>> git clone https://github.com/chrisjsewell/pytest-notebook
>> cd pytest-notebook/examples
>> pip install pytest ipykernel pytest-notebook
>> pytest --nb-test-files *.ipynb
```

You should see `success.ipynb` passed the test and `fail.ipynb` failed the test.

You can regenerate the outputs of `fail.ipynb` with the `--nb-force-regen` flag:

```shell
>> pytest --nb-test-files --nb-force-regen *.ipynb
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome.

The following will discover and run all unit test:

```shell
>> pip install -e .[testing]
>> pytest -v
```

### Coding Style Requirements

The code style is tested using [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org),
with the configuration set in `.flake8`,
and code should be formatted with [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).

Installing with `pytest-notebook[code_style]` makes the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
package available, which will ensure these tests are passed by reformatting the code
and testing for lint errors before submitting a commit.
It can be setup by:

```shell
>> cd pytest-notebook
>> pre-commit install
```

Optionally you can run `black` and `flake8` separately:

```shell
>> black .
>> flake8 .
```

Editors like VS Code also have automatic code reformat utilities, which can adhere to this standard.
